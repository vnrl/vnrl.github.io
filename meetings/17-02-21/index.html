        <p>[12:11 PM] Off. Lawrence Martin, PCT. 02: We need a prosecutor tho</p>
        <p>[12:11 PM] MG Florida: I second</p>
        <p>[12:11 PM] Aānaāk Desslok: hes online</p>
        <p>[12:11 PM] MG Florida: I can prosecute</p>
        <p>[12:11 PM] Off. Lawrence Martin, PCT. 02: OK</p>
        <p>[12:12 PM] Off. Lawrence Martin, PCT. 02: Desslok, is that ok?</p>
        <p>[12:12 PM] Off. Lawrence Martin, PCT. 02: If Sayaka comes into the meeting, then should we switch over?</p>
        <p>[12:12 PM] Capt. Ermatveit OEV, PCT.01, MoE: Yes</p>
        <p>[12:12 PM] Off. Lawrence Martin, PCT. 02: OK</p>
        <p>[12:12 PM] MG Florida: Yes</p>
        <p>[12:13 PM] Capt. Ermatveit OEV, PCT.01, MoE: The prosecutor (in this case an 'acting prosecutor') should present their opening statement</p>
        <p>[12:13 PM] MG Florida: Ok</p>
        <p>[12:16 PM] Capt. Ermatveit OEV, PCT.01, MoE: My opening statement as Chief Defender on the case of Vuaqavan Impeachment Chamber v. GoldAxe</p>
        <p>I doubt the claim that we (as a governing body and acting jury for the impeachment of a Minister-General) should scrutinise a duly elected official for proceeding with the revokal of access to this server (known as 'banning.')  Although the evidence is hard to come by, I don't believe these acts were conducted with malice and intent of corruption. Therefore, we should acquit GoldAxe.</p>
        <p>[12:16 PM] Capt. Ermatveit OEV, PCT.01, MoE: There we go</p>
        <p>[12:19 PM] Off. Lawrence Martin, PCT. 02:</p>
        <p>I don't believe these acts were conducted with malice and intent of corruption.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>That is entirely circumstantial.</p>
        <p>[12:19 PM] MG Florida: I believe that GoldAxe, in his leadership of the nation, has shown himself to be a dictator and must be removed from office.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>He has lied about his powers to intimidate myself into “respecting” him, which I believe is a violation of the right to free speech. He has additionally attempted to censor criticism of Vuaqava by TinakulanLeader, which I believe to be a dictatorial act too.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>GoldAxe then went on to act on his threats, demoting me from the position of Deputy without a democratic vote. GoldAxe then censored me, followed by banning several members of this server without any reason.</p>
        <p>[12:19 PM] Capt. Ermatveit OEV, PCT.01, MoE: Now I proceed to criticise the Prosecutor's arguments and he scrutinises mine</p>
        <p>[12:20 PM] Capt. Ermatveit OEV, PCT.01, MoE: I move to adjourn the session and can find no fault with the Prosecutor's arguments.</p>
        <p>[12:20 PM] Off. Lawrence Martin, PCT. 02: no</p>
        <p>[12:20 PM] Off. Lawrence Martin, PCT. 02: we need to get a verdict</p>
        <p>[12:21 PM] MG Florida: May I ask how banning completely random members of this server is not done with intent to cause harm?</p>
        <p>[12:21 PM] Capt. Ermatveit OEV, PCT.01, MoE: No.</p>
        <p>[12:21 PM] Capt. Ermatveit OEV, PCT.01, MoE: I completely agree with you.</p>
        <p>[12:21 PM] Capt. Ermatveit OEV, PCT.01, MoE: But I needed to write something</p>
        <p>[12:21 PM] Off. Lawrence Martin, PCT. 02: UnitedWorlds, a revered sergeant and minister, was banned without reason, as was Sayaka.</p>
        <p>[12:21 PM] MG Florida: As was Phuanon and Maison Ikkoku streamy streamy</p>
        <p>[12:22 PM] Aānaāk Desslok: And deletion of channels</p>
        <p>[12:22 PM] Capt. Ermatveit OEV, PCT.01, MoE: Motion to impeach GoldAxe for high crimes and misdemeanour against the Vuaqavan State, namely the unlawful revokal of citizenship, without due process and reason, of several Vuaqavan citizens (as detailed above) and for the deletion of communication channels within this server.</p>
        <p>[12:22 PM] MG Florida: Based</p>
        <p>[12:22 PM] Aānaāk Desslok: Yes</p>
        <p>[12:22 PM] MG Florida: I second</p>
        <p>[12:22 PM] Aānaāk Desslok: I second this</p>
        <p>[12:23 PM] Off. Lawrence Martin, PCT. 02: Seconded.</p>
        <p>[12:23 PM] Capt. Ermatveit OEV, PCT.01, MoE: Do we need all ministers to vote?</p>
        <p>[12:23 PM] Off. Lawrence Martin, PCT. 02: Yes</p>
        <p>[12:23 PM] Off. Lawrence Martin, PCT. 02: I believe the defendant, GoldAxe, to be guilty.</p>
        <p>[12:24 PM] Off. Lawrence Martin, PCT. 02: (everyone has to say)</p>
        <p>[12:24 PM] MG Florida: I motion to bar GoldAxe from holding government positions.</p>
        <p>[12:24 PM] Off. Lawrence Martin, PCT. 02: that's impeachment</p>
        <p>[12:24 PM] MG Florida: I believe him to be guilty</p>
        <p>[12:24 PM] Capt. Ermatveit OEV, PCT.01, MoE: Yes. Motion to abstain from revokal of citizenship.</p>
        <p>[12:24 PM] Capt. Ermatveit OEV, PCT.01, MoE: Rather to prosecute in order to bar from federal office</p>
        <p>[12:25 PM] Aānaāk Desslok: I also find him gulty</p>
        <p>[12:25 PM] MG Florida: I mean like police and public sector things</p>
        <p>[12:25 PM] Off. Lawrence Martin, PCT. 02: Nobody was trying to revoke citizenship</p>
        <p>[12:25 PM] Capt. Ermatveit OEV, PCT.01, MoE: That is what banning is</p>
        <p>[12:25 PM] Capt. Ermatveit OEV, PCT.01, MoE: But I suppose he was unbanned</p>
        <p>[12:25 PM] Off. Lawrence Martin, PCT. 02: You will become the comissioner if GA is found guilty, so you can decide if he gets to join</p>
        <p>[12:26 PM] Off. Lawrence Martin, PCT. 02: Final call for voting. Green for guilty, red for not guilty, purple for abstinence.</p>
        <p>[12:26 PM] Capt. Ermatveit OEV, PCT.01, MoE: @Off. Lawrence Martin, PCT. 02 remove all reactions other than your vote</p>
        <p>[12:27 PM] Off. Lawrence Martin, PCT. 02: The jury finds the defendant guilty of all charges.</p>
        <p>[12:27 PM] Off. Lawrence Martin, PCT. 02: Desslok, please begin a transfer of power.</p>
        <p>[12:27 PM] MG Florida: Hurrah</p>
        <p>[12:28 PM] Off. Lawrence Martin, PCT. 02: Matt will become the deputy MG, we need to elect a new President of the Chamber.</p>
        <p>[12:28 PM] Capt. Ermatveit OEV, PCT.01, MoE: Oh call</p>
        <p>[12:28 PM] Capt. Ermatveit OEV, PCT.01, MoE: damn</p>

        <p>[12:30 PM] Off. Lawrence Martin, PCT. 02: You're the current President of the Chamber, as the MG has become impeached, the DMG takes on the role, and the PotC becomes the DMG</p>
